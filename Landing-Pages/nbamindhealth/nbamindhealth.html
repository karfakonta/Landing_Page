        <h2>Your mental wellness is as important as your physical health.</h2>

            <p>We’ve heard the lessons since childhood: Brush your teeth before bed. Stretch before running. Don’t eat right before swimming. And yes, it’s important to keep tabs on how your body is running physically. But it’s just as important to be aware of how you’re doing mentally.</p>
            <p> <strong>NBA Mind Health</strong> wants to remind you to pause and check in with yourself. Ask yourself how you’re feeling and what you can do to support those around you. Like shooting 100 free throws or lifting weights, finding ways to take care of your mind can lay the foundation for wellness and success.</p>
